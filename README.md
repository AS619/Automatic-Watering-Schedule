# 💧 Automatic Watering Schedule for a Growing Platform🌿🍃

### 🌱 Automatic Watering Schedule for Plants: Developing a machine learning model to assess real-time water requirements for plants.

* This model is designed to make precise decisions on when to activate or deactivate the watering motor based on the environmental and soil conditions. A water motor can be operated by us with this model. Three-month period of data previously collected that had been grown on the platform was used in this model building.

Three different machine learning algorithms' outputs have been checked to find the best model. 
These algorithms included:

                 - 🌐 Gaussian Naive Bayes
                 - 🌲 Decision Tree Classifier
                 - 🌳 Random Forest Classifier

🔍 Through extensive testing and evaluation, the Random Forest Classifier was the best option.<br>
🚀 Its ability to provide the most accurate predictions. It is noteworthy that the Random Forest Classifier has exhibited an impressive accuracy rate of **93.81%** in its decision-making processes.<br>
👀 This high accuracy is a testament to the model's effectiveness in gauging the plants' moisture needs and ensuring that watering is administered with precision. This is an advanced machine learning approach.
